    <p class="mb-4">
      Spondle is an event discovery and management platform designed to make it easier for organisers to create, share, and promote events of all kinds — from live music and comedy to community gatherings and festivals.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Our goal is to connect event seekers with organisers in a way that’s seamless, engaging, and visually appealing. Whether you’re managing a small local gig or a full tour, Spondle gives you the tools to showcase your events beautifully.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Event organisers can create custom microsites, integrate their events on their own websites using our plugin, and track engagement through analytics dashboards — all powered by a modern, user-friendly interface.
